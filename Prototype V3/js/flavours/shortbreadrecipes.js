  instructions: [

    " ",

    "<li>Pre-heat oven to 325° (160° celsius).</li><li>In a medium bowl cream butter and icing sugar till very fluffy. Beat in salt, cornstarch, vanilla and flour. Beat until very light, stir in chocolate chips. Drop by teaspoon full (or roll into balls the size of a golfball and lightly flatten with a fork)  onto parchment paper lined cookie sheets. Bake for approximately 15-20 minutes** (until very lightly golden (almost white) never browned). Let cool completely. Enjoy!</li><li>Makes approximately 2 dozen cookies</li><li>Start to check the cookies after 10-12 minutes, depending on the size they may take less time to bake.</li>",

    "<li>In a small mixing bowl whisk together the flour, cornstarch and salt. Set aside.</li><li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the butter, granulated sugar and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. Beat at medium speed until the butter mixture is creamy and light. Scrape down the sides of mixing bowl as needed. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the flour mixture. Mix until well blended. Cover and refrigerate the dough for 1 hours.</li><li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Shape dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart on the prepared pan. Keep remaining cookie dough refrigerated until needed. Make an indentation straight down into the center of each cookie (about half way to the bottom) with your smallest finger. Fill each with a well rounded 1/4 teaspoon jam.</li><li>Bake for 11 to 15 minutes or until edges are just lightly browned. Let the cookies stand 1 minute before removing to a cooling rack. Cool completely.</li><li>Combine the glaze ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Drizzle over cookies and allow them to set. </li><li>When measuring the flour, lightly spoon into measuring cup and level off the top with the flat side of a table knife. Do not pack the flour into the cup.</li><li>Be sure you are using raspberry jam. Do not use jelly.</li><li>If your dough is dry and crumbly, you probably added too much flour. Try adding 1 tablespoon of butter to the cookie dough.</li><li>I always use Land-O-Lakes unsalted butter in all my recipes. If you use salted butter please omit the 1/4 teaspoon additional salt added with the flour.</li><li>Do not over-bake. The cookies are best just lightly browned on the bottom.</li><li>To prevent the cookies from spreading too much please note:Make sure the dough is well chilled before making the dough balls.</li><li>Keep dough refrigerated between batches. With a high butter content, the dough will quickly warm when left at room temperature.</li><li>Place dough balls on a cool baking sheet, or parchment paper. The cookies will begin to spread if placed on a hot pan. To make it easy you can place the dough balls on parchment and then slide them onto a rimless baking pan and bake immediately. I use a light colored rimless baking sheet to make this process easy and quick.</li><li>Do not smash the entire dough ball flat when making the indentation. Use a small finger and push straight down into the center of the cookie. DO NOT MAKE THE INDENTION TOO DEEP. The bigger the whole, the wider the cookies will spread. Please see the photos for reference. Even though they are called thumbprints, if you use your thumb they may not spread correctly and hold the jelly in the pocket.</li><li>Bake 3-4 cookies first to see how they do for you. If they are spreading too much, refrigerate the dough balls with jam for 15 minutes before baking.Adapted from a Land-O-Lakes recipe</li>",

    "<li>Cream the butter and the sugar together.</li><li>Beat in the vanilla.</li><li>Whisk together the flour and cornstarch. Blend them into the butter and sugar, until it forms a dough.</li><li>Stir in the pistachios and make sure you get them well distributed in the dough.</li><li>Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and form it into a log, about 9 or 10 inches long. Wrap it in the plastic and smooth it into a uniform smooth shape, twisting the ends to secure.</li><li>Refrigerate the dough for at least 3 hours, or overnight.</li><li>Set oven to 350F</li><li>Slice the dough into 1/4 - 1/3 inch slices and place on a parchment or silpat lined baking sheet. Thinner slices will bake up crispier, and thicker ones will be more buttery and soft.</li><li>Bake for about 10 minutes, maybe a little longer for thicker cookies. The cookies will still be pale and soft, but will firm up as they cool.</li><li>Cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet, then cool completely on a rack.</li>",

    "<li>Cream together the butter and icing sugar very well until very smooth and creamy. No lumps of butter should be visible.</li><li>Blend in the vanilla extract.</li><li>Sift together the flour and corn starch.</li><li>Blend slowly into the creamed mixture until a soft dough forms.</li><li>Split dough into 2 equal round portions.</li><li>Wrap the dough rounds in plastic wrap and chill for a couple of hours at least.</li><li>You can freeze one of the cookie dough portions for later if you like.</li><li>This dough will also last in the fridge for 3-4 days so that you can bake a few up at a time and enjoy them fresh from the oven if you like.</li><li>To bake the cookies preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line cookie sheets with parchment paper.</li><li>Roll the dough out to a little less than 1/4 of an inch on a lightly floured surface. Use a 2 inch cookie cutter (or holiday shaped cookie cutters) to cut out the cookies.</li><li>Place the cookies on the parchment paper a half inch apart. Add a half maraschino or glacé cherry to the center, or a baking gumdrop if you like.</li><li>Bake for 15-20 minutes or until they just start to turn brown at the edges.</li><li>Let cool for 10 minutes on the pan before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.</li><li>These cookies will freeze quite well for several weeks. </li>",

    "<li>Gather the ingredients.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 325 F/170 C.</li><li>In a large bowl cream together the butter, salt, and sugar until light and fluffy and pale in colour. This can take at least 10 minutes. You don't have to do this by hand, you can use an electric mixer if you have one and this will be much quicker.</li><li>In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour and cornstarch and sieve into the bowl of butter and sugar. Mix quickly and thoroughly to bring all the ingredients together but do not over mix as you will risk the danger of making the shortbread warm and thus it will have a poor crumb.</li><li>Tip the mixture onto a lightly floured work surface and knead lightly and quickly to form a loose dough.</li><li>Roll out the dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper to 1/4-inch/1-cm thick. Prick the surface all over with a fork. Cut into desired shape or rounds using cookie cutters.</li><li>Place the Scottish shortbreads on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes or until pale brown and crisp. Sprinkle the warm Scottish shortbreads with superfine sugar and let cool completely on a wire rack.</li><li>enjoy</li><li>Store in an airtight tin or box.</li>",

    "<li>Preheat oven to 325 F degrees. </li><li>Add the butter to a large bowl and blend it until smooth using an electric mixer set at medium speed for about 30 seconds. </li><li>Add the icing sugar and continue mixing until well incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and combine thoroughly. </li><li>Add flour and mix at low speed until well blended. The mixture will be crumbled and soft. </li><li>Pat dough into an ungreased cookie sheet, lined with parchment paper with the parchment paper hanging off the sides to make it easy to lift out the cookies. Alternatively you can roll out the dough so that it's about 1/4 of an inch in thickness, you can knead it a bit just so that the dough comes together, but don't overwork it, then cut into your desired shape. </li><li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until just done (slightly golden in colour). Do not let them get brown. Remove from the oven. If using a cookie sheet, lift out the cookies from the sheet using the parchment paper and cut into desired shapes. Finish cooling the cookies on a rack. </li>",

    "<li>PREHEAT oven to 325F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.</li><li>WHISK flour, cornstarch and salt in a bowl.</li><li>BEAT butter and sugar in a large bowl using an electric mixer on medium-high until very fluffy and aerated, 4 to 5 min, scraping sides and bottom of bowl. Add milk and vanilla and beat for 1 min.</li><li>SIFT in half of the flour mixture, then fold in with a spatula until just combined. Repeat. Spoon half of the shortbread batter into a piping bag fitted with a large, open star tip.</li><li>PIPE batter into 1 1/2-in.-wide rosettes, 1 in. apart, on a prepared sheet.</li><li>BAKE shortbread until edges are lightly browned, 15 to 16 min. Let cool for 3 min, then transfer to a rack to cool. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>",

    "<li>In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter until light. Stir in the cornstarch and sugar. Gradually add the flour mixing until a soft dough forms. Form dough in to a ball and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes to chill.</li><li>On a lightly floured surface, roll your dough 1/4-inch thick. Take care to ensure that your dough is rolled as evenly as possible, so that cookies cook evenly. Using a cookie cutter, cut shapes and place on to an un-greased baking sheet. You can re-roll your scraps and cut more, as well. Once your cookies are cut, top with quartered glace cherries, sprinkles or nuts. Place cookie sheet with cookies in to the freezer for 10-15 minutes. (You can also freeze the cut dough in freezer bags once solid on the cookie sheet for up to 2 weeks and bake later or as needed.)</li><li>Preheat oven to 275°F with rack in centre of oven. Bake for about 30 minutes for cookies that have been lightly chilled. If cooking from frozen, they may take up to 45 minutes. Cookies should be firm but shouldn't brown at all, even around the edges. They really just dry as they cook.</li><li>Cool on racks then transfer to cookie tin or freeze. These cookies keep well and get better with age.</li>"

    "Old Fashioned Shortbread Cookies. A life-long love of shortbread cookies has meant many variations in my kitchen over the years but at Christmas time I always return to the simple recipe I loved as a child. ",

    "The success of a 'shortie'—a nickname for shortbread—is to handle the dough with care and as little as possible. Do not pound or knead heavily and make sure your hands and the dishes you use are cold. The resulting shortbread will then be light and crumbly with a dense buttery taste otherwise, the crumb will not be the same. ",

    "These shortbread cookies are simply the best around. Your house will smell incredible, I couldn’t wait till they came out of the oven, just desperately needed to put one in my mouth as soon as possible. ",
