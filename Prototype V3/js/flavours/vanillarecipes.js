  instructions: [
    
    " ",
    
    "<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be almost entirely in liquid form.</li><li>Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated – 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).</li><li>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet” dough and “dry” dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.</li><li>Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they’re not done yet. They’ll be pale and puffy.</li><li>Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so. They will sink down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an airtight container. I also like to freeze them.</li>",
    
    "<li>In a small bowl whisk together dry ingredients: flour, corn starch, salt and baking powder, set aside.</li><li>Cream butter and sugar on high speed for about 2 minutes, until light and creamy. Add egg and vanilla and mix to combine.</li><li>Running your mixer on low, mix in dry ingredients mix.</li><li>Fold in about ¾ of white chocolate chunks, reserve remaining to press on top of cookies.</li><li>Finally, fold in blueberries with a rubber spatula, but do this really gently and try not to break the berries. The dough will be thick and sticky. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.</li><li>To make the filling, mix cream cheese, vanilla and powdered sugar just to combine and place in the fridge.</li><li>When ready to bake preheat the oven to 350 F and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li><li>To assemble the cookies, scoop one heaping tablespoon of dough and make a deep bowl. Fill with 1 teaspoon of cream cheese mixture and about ¾ teaspoons of blueberry jam. Top with ½ Tablespoon of cookie dough and seal any openings. Roll gently to make a ball. Press a few white chocolate chunks on top and sides of each cookie. Before baking freeze cookie balls for 10 minutes (if you don’t have enough space or baking sheet in the freezer, place rolled cookies on a tray lined with parchment paper and freeze, and transfer on baking sheet when ready to bake)</li><li>Arrange cookie balls onto baking sheet leaving 3 inches apart, because the cookies will spread while baking. Bake 16-18 minutes. Cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer on a rack too cool completely.</li>",
    
    "<li>To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl and hand mixer), add the egg, butter, sugars, vanilla, and beat on medium-high to cream ingredients until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.</li><li>Stop, scape down the sides of the bowl and add the oats, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, optional salt, and beat to just incorporate, about 1 minute. Add the butterscotch chips and beat momentarily to incorporate.</li><li>Using a 2-inch medium cookie scoop (about 2 tablespoons), form dough mounds (I made 20). Place dough mounds on a large plate. Flatten mounds slightly. Cover plate with plasticwrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, and up to 5 days, before baking. Do not bake with warm dough; cookies will spread and bake thin and flat.</li><li>Preheat oven to 350F, line 2 baking sheets with Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mats, parchment, or spray with cooking spray. Place mounds on baking sheets, spaced about 2 inches apart. I bake 8 to a tray. Bake for 9 to 10 minutes, or until edges are set and tops are barely set, even if slightly underbaked in the center and glossy. Cookies may not appear to be done, but they firm up dramatically as they cool. Baking longer results in cookies with dark or burnt bottoms and that set up too crisp and hard and don’t stay soft over time.</li><li>Allow cookies to cool on trays for about 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling. Store cookies airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.</li>",
    
    "<li>Whip egg whites and lemon juice together with a stand mixer or hand mixer until stiff peaks form.</li><li>Using a fine mesh sieve, sift in almond flour, 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar, salt, and baking powder and fold into egg whites. I don't do it all at once but maybe in 2-3 batches. Try to keep some air in the egg whites, but at this point it will form a pretty sticky dough rather than a fluffy meringue.</li><li>Add orange zest, vanilla extract, and almond extract and fold in until combined.</li><li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using clean hands, roll dough into balls about 1 inch in diameter, then roll in powdered sugar until well coated. Shape into an oval, then arrange on baking sheet with some space between them for spreading, and flatten slightly.</li><li>Leave at room temperature for about an hour or until the tops have dried out and formed almost a little shell. (This may take longer in humid areas.) Pre-crack the shell by squeezing the cookies slightly from opposite corners. (Not doing this won't affect the taste, but pre-cracking them makes them much prettier if you want that beautiful white-gold contrast!)</li><li>While cookies are drying, preheat oven to 300 degrees. When the cookies are ready, bake for about 20 minutes. Cool and store in an airtight container. These are even better the next day and are great with coffee or tea! </li>",
    
    "<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li><li>In a large bowl, cream together butter, peanut butter, 1 cup sugar, and brown sugar.</li><li>Add vanilla and mix.</li><li>Add the eggs in one at a time, mixing well after each one.</li><li>In a separate bowl mix the flour, baking soda and salt together. Add to mixture in mixing bowl and stir until completely combined.</li><li>Fold in peanut butter chips.</li><li>Roll dough into 1 1/2 inch balls.</li><li>Place 1/4 cup sugar into a small bowl and roll each ball of dough in the sugar until completely covered.</li><li>Place rolled dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or sprayed with nonstick cooking spray and gently press each dough ball down to 1/2 inch thick.</li><li>Bake the cookies for 7-9 minutes.</li><li>Remove cookies and allow them to cool on their cookie sheet for about 5 minutes, then move to a wire rack to finish cooling.</li><li>These cookies are very soft - you don't want them to over bake or turn brown at all. They will continue to set-up as they cool.</li>",
    
    "<li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li><li>Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium sized bowl and set aside.<li><li>Cream the butter and sugar together in a larger mixer bowl on medium speed until light in color and fluffy.<li><li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until well combined after each. Add the coconut extract an mix until well combined.<li><li>Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix until the dough comes together and is combined.<li><li>Create 1 1/2 tablespoon sized balls of cookie dough. Gently roll into a ball, then roll each ball in sugar to coat. Set the balls on the baking sheet.<li><li>Use the bottom of a glass to press down lightly on the balls of dough, so that the dough balls are about 1/2 inch wide.<li><li>Bake cookies for 8-10 minutes. The cookies will spread a bit and the centers will look soft. Don’t over bake.<li><li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool on baking sheets for 3-4 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.<li><li>When the cookies are cool, add the melting wafers to a small bowl and melt according to package instructions.<li><li>Add the melted chocolate to a piping bag with a small round icing tip (I used Wilton 3) and drizzle over the cookies. If you won’t have a piping bag and icing tip, you can use a ziplock bag and snip off a small part of one corner of the bag.<li><li>Add the sprinkles to the chocolate while still melted. Allow chocolate to dry.<li><li>Cookies will stay fresh in an airtight container at room temperature for 4-5 days.<li>",
    
    "<li>In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda and salt (I use a whisk), and set aside.</li><li>Cream the butter and sugars together with a mixer (stand or hand-held). Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla and mix well until just combined.</li><li>Add the flour mixture in batches, mixing to combine in between each batch, until all the flour is incorporated.</li><li>Stir in the white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts.</li><li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill dough for about an hour.</li><li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.</li><li>Press a few more white chocolate chips and macadamia nut pieces onto the tops for extra flavor and presentation. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until edges just ever so slightly browned. The centers of the cookies will look very soft and a little puffy. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few seconds, then transfer to a wire cooling rack.</li>",

    "<li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the butter, cane and confectioners sugar, sea salt and vanilla bean paste. Mix on medium for about 2 minutes or until smooth (not fluffy), stopping to scrape bowl at least once. Add the bourbon and vanilla extract and mix again on medium for about 30 seconds, or until incorporated. Scrape down bowl. Add the flour all at once, pulse to start, then mix on medium until the dough forms somewhat of a ball on the paddle and has pulled away from sides of the bowl.</li><li>On a floured work surface, dump out dough and divide in half. Shape each clump into a log, 2 inch (5cm) thick, gently rolling and adding flour as needed so it wont stick to you or the work surface. If the log becomes hollow, condition the dough by pinching it closed and reroll into a log. Wrap each log in plastic wrap. Carefully place in refrigerator on a flat surface for at least two hours or up to two days.v<li>At this point the dough can be frozen for up to two months. Be sure to double wrap the logs if freezing.</li> <li>Remove the log(s) from the refrigerator, unwrap it and using a pastry brush, brush a thin layer of egg white all over the surface of the dough. Sprinkle the log with raw sugar, rolling it as needed to cover the surface areas.</li><li>Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Using a serrated knife, firmly cut the cookies 1/2 inch(1 1/4cm) thick. Place on sheet pan with at least 1 inch (2 1/2 cm) between cookies. Place back in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes (do not skip this step or the cookies will spread). Preheat oven to 350F (180C).</li><li>Bake cookies for 25-27 minutes or until they begin to turn golden. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack.</li><li>Store in a covered container at room temperature for up to two weeks.</li>"
